## Project Description
---
I created Moovee to assist in creating a Movie Night list. I had been managing a discord post as a movie list and had to update the post every time anyone wanted to add or remove a title from the list. 

I figured there should be an easier way...

The intent of this project was to create a database list of the movies our group wanted to watch, organized by genre, that would be managed automatically by a bot. Users could manipulate the list via the bot and make whatever changes were needed on the spot. It would also provide a "random" movie from the list for those who can't decide what to pick on their night.

(I really just wanted to not have to update that post any longer...)
